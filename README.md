# rFMS_database

These SQL statments will install the minimal needed data into your MySQL or MariaDB database.
First create a database called 'rFMS-reading' or any preffered name.
Load the file into your database, at first the 'rFMS_MySQL_Structure.sql' to ensure the proper tables are there before loading the second file

Both file are needed for the rFMS-API-ETL as backend and the rFMSConnect as frontend.
